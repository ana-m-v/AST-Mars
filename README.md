## Critical parts explained

### Given Intervals:
- **Deimos (D)**: [13:91 to 23:05] (in Mars-minutes)
- **Phobos (P)**: [22:05 to 24:45] (in Mars-minutes)

### Intervals in Mars-Minutes:
- D_start = 1391, D_end = 2305
- P_start = 2205, P_end = 2445

### Calculating the Overlap:
- **Start of the Overlap**: The overlap begins at the later of the two start times:
  - max(1391, 2205) = 2205
  - So, the overlap starts at 2205 (which is Phobos' start time).

- **End of the Overlap**: The overlap ends at the earlier of the two end times:
  - min(2305, 2445) = 2305
  - So, the overlap ends at 2305.

Thus, the overlap is from 2205 to 2305, which is **100 minutes**.

### Conclusion:
The reason we use `max(D_start, P_start)` for calculating the start of the overlap is to ensure that we only start counting when both intervals are active. This ensures that the overlap begins only when the later of the two intervals starts, preventing us from counting time when one of the moons is not yet visible.

This approach guarantees that we accurately calculate the duration of the overlap in situations where the intervals might start and end at different times, including cases where one interval starts later than the other. The use of `max` ensures that we're not counting time when one moon is not visible yet, thus ensuring correctness in the overlap calculation.


## Tests

### 1. **Basic Overlap (Positive)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**: 
     - If the algorithm fails to detect basic overlap, it could lead to incorrect or missing results in experiments where moon visibility is critical. This could compromise the accuracy of scientific data regarding when both moons are visible.
     - **Severity**: Medium. A failure here impacts the scientific validity of data but can often be detected and corrected quickly.

### 2. **No Overlap (Negative)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - If the program incorrectly returns an overlap when none exists, it could lead to misinterpreting data, assuming both moons are visible when they are not. This would lead to false conclusions about the behavior of the moons.
     - **Severity**: High. Misidentifying when the moons overlap could lead to experimental failures, impacting scientific conclusions.

### 3. **Twilight Rule (Touching at One Point)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - If the Twilight Rule is not applied correctly, intervals that merely touch could incorrectly result in zero minutes of overlap. This would invalidate the rule, resulting in miscalculated time periods when the moons are visible.
     - **Severity**: Medium. While this may not be a major issue, it is a **critical edge case** that needs proper handling, particularly in situations where precise timing is needed.

### 4. **Deimos Starts Late, Overlap Crosses Midnight**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - If the algorithm cannot handle the wraparound from one Mars day to the next, it could lead to significant errors, such as missing the overlap entirely or reporting the wrong time range.
     - **Severity**: High. A failure here could cause a **significant loss of accuracy** in determining when the moons are visible, especially since Mars days are longer than Earth days and span across boundaries. This could have a major impact on experiments relying on accurate timing.

### 5. **Full Overlap (Positive)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - A failure here would mean that when both moons are visible at the same time, the program might report incorrect overlap minutes. This would distort the data about moon visibility, which could lead to wrong conclusions about the dynamics of Mars moons.
     - **Severity**: Medium. Though not catastrophic, failing this test case would reduce the reliability of the system, potentially undermining results when full overlap occurs.

### 6. **No Overlap, but Touching at One Point (Negative, Twilight Rule)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - A failure would mean that the algorithm misses the **Twilight Rule** and wrongly reports `0` minutes of overlap. This would result in **inaccurate visibility data** when the moons are only touching at one point, affecting any subsequent calculations or conclusions.
     - **Severity**: Medium. It is an edge case, but failure here would undermine a rule that is important for accurate scientific measurement.

### 7. **Boundary Case: Interval Starts at Midnight (Positive)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - If the algorithm doesn't properly handle intervals that start at the **boundary of the Mars day**, it could fail to recognize overlaps that occur at the start of the day, leading to **incorrect moon visibility data**.
     - **Severity**: High. Since many experiments may start at midnight, it is critical that the program can handle this boundary case properly.

### 8. **Boundary Case: Interval Ends at Midnight (Negative)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - If the program doesn't correctly handle intervals that end at midnight, it could either miscalculate the duration of the interval or miss overlaps that occur up until midnight.
     - **Severity**: High. Similar to the previous case, any errors at this boundary could lead to **incorrect visibility data**, affecting scientific experiments and analyses.

### 9. **Phobos Starts After Deimos (Positive)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - If the program incorrectly handles this situation, it could fail to identify overlap or miscalculate the minutes of overlap, leading to **inaccurate results** about moon visibility, which is crucial for certain scientific measurements.
     - **Severity**: Medium. This is a common case, and while the consequences are not as severe as wraparound issues, inaccuracies still affect the results.

### 10. **Phobos Fully Inside Deimos' Interval (Positive)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - Failure to handle this case would lead to the algorithm reporting no overlap or incorrectly calculating overlap. This would cause the system to fail to identify **important visibility periods**.
     - **Severity**: Medium. While less critical than boundary issues, this would still compromise the accuracy of results and misrepresent the moon visibility.

### 11. **No Overlap, Phobos Starts Early and Ends Late (Negative)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - Failure to identify when two intervals don't overlap would result in **incorrect visibility data** and might lead to experiments based on faulty assumptions.
     - **Severity**: Medium. While this case is negative, misidentifying this scenario could lead to **false conclusions** about when the moons are visible.

### 12. **Deimos Starts Early in the Day (Positive)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - If the algorithm can't handle this case properly, it might fail to detect overlap when one moon starts early in the day, resulting in **inaccurate visibility data** for that period.
     - **Severity**: Medium. Itâ€™s common for moons to start early, and failure here would affect visibility calculations, though not as critically as other boundary cases.

### 13. **Deimos and Phobos Intervals Are Completely Different (Negative)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - Failure to identify that the two intervals don't overlap would lead to a **false positive** overlap, where the system assumes the moons are visible together when they are not.
     - **Severity**: High. This would lead to **false scientific conclusions** about moon visibility, which could drastically affect experiments and calculations.

### 14. **Intervals Overlap for Exactly One Minute (Twilight Rule)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - Misapplication of the Twilight Rule would lead to the program incorrectly returning `0` for this case, which would misrepresent the actual overlap. This is particularly important when precise timing is required for scientific experiments.
     - **Severity**: High. This test case is critical because it affects the precision of the results when the moons are almost overlapping, impacting any analysis relying on accurate timings.

### 15. **Phobos' Interval Spans Midnight (Critical Negative)**:
   - **Consequences of Failure**:
     - Failure to handle this scenario would lead to the program missing the overlap entirely or incorrectly calculating it due to wraparound issues. This would **severely impact experiments** that rely on knowing the exact periods when both moons are visible.
     - **Severity**: Very High. This is a critical test case because any failure here can **render all visibility calculations for Phobos invalid** for overlapping intervals crossing midnight.

---

### Overall Consequences:
The **most severe consequences** come from failure in boundary cases (e.g., wraparound, midnight boundaries), the **Twilight Rule**, and scenarios where moons have no overlap or touch at exactly one point. These cases are often where the most complex logic lies, and if they are not handled correctly, it could lead to **major inaccuracies** in scientific measurements.

Errors in calculating moon visibility can have **serious consequences** for experiments, such as incorrect timing for astronomical observations, failures in synchronizing experiments, or even invalid data conclusions. This is why it's crucial to test these scenarios thoroughly.
